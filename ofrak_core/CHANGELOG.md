  - CLI tool added to track and install dependencies & components:
    - `python -m ofrak list` lists installed OFRAK modules and/or components.
    - `python -m ofrak deps` shows and checks external (non-Python) dependencies of OFRAK components, and shows hints on how they might be installed.
  - `OFRAKContext` logs if a discovered component is missing an external dependency; these components can be excluded using the `exclude_components_missing_depenencies` parameter in `OFRAK`.
- Speed improvements to `Resource.unpack_recursively` method.

### Changed
- `Resource.{write_to, flush_to_disk}` now have optional `pack` parameter to pack before writing.

  - Removed `ElfProgramHeaderPermission`, replaced usage with `MemoryPermissions` (from `ofrak-type`).
  - Remove unused `Elf,{get_sections_after_index, get_sections_before_index, get_section_header_by_name, get_string_section_header`.
  - Removed `get_parent`/`get_elf` from Elf resource views, `UnanalyzedElfSegment`, `ElfSegmentStructureIndexAnalyzer`, `ElfSectionStructureIndexAnalyzer`, `ElfSymbolStructureIndexAnalyzer`, `ElfModifierUtils`.

### Fixed
- `Resource.create_child` takes either `data` or `data_range` arguments, but not both.
- Remove duplicated work from in resource service serialization, making it faster.
- Miscellaneous bugs in documentation.
- Added `beartype` as requirement for `ofrak`.
- Bump to `fun-coverage==0.2.0` for more accurate test coverage reporting.
