## [Unreleased](https://github.com/redballoonsecurity/ofrak/tree/master)
### Changed
- Refactored `DataService` internals to more efficiently find resources affected by patches [#140](https://github.com/redballoonsecurity/ofrak/pull/140)

### Deprecated
- Deprecate `view_type.attributes_type` in favor of `AttributesType[view_type]` [#149](https://github.com/redballoonsecurity/ofrak/pull/149)

### Fixed

- Added missing elf section types to ElfSectionType [#178](https://github.com/redballoonsecurity/ofrak/pull/178)

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/redballoonsecurity/ofrak/releases/tag/ofrak-v2.0.0) - 2023-01-03
### Added
- `ofrak` now contains all the components that were in the (now sunset) `ofrak_components` package.
- Add components for analyzing, unpacking, and repacking raw flash dumps.
- UF2 unpacker and packer added.
- Several new features to make tracking and installing external dependencies easier (for non-Docker users):
  - Components can now mark their external tool dependencies using the `external_dependencies` attribute.
  - CLI tool added to track and install dependencies & components:
    - `python -m ofrak list` lists installed OFRAK modules and/or components.
    - `python -m ofrak deps` shows and checks external (non-Python) dependencies of OFRAK components, and shows hints on how they might be installed.
  - `OFRAKContext` logs if a discovered component is missing an external dependency; these components can be excluded using the `exclude_components_missing_depenencies` parameter in `OFRAK`.
- Speed improvements to `Resource.unpack_recursively` method.

### Changed
- `Resource.{write_to, flush_to_disk}` now have optional `pack` parameter to pack before writing.
- Resource views are now updated when `Resource.save` is run.
- `DataService` was refactored for speed and clarity of implementation. It also now allows sibling Resources to overlap with each other.
- Free space components decoupled from ISA.
- `Filesystem.initialize_from_disk` raises `FileNotFoundError` when path does not exist or is not a file ([@galbwe](https://github.com/galbwe)).
- Rename `RawExtendModifier` to `BinaryExtendModifier`.
- `ElfProgramHeader` simplified to have only one method, `get_memory_permissions`.
- Switch to using PyPI versions of keystone & capstone.
- `PeOptionalHeader` divided into 32 and 64 bit.

### Removed
- Removed unused, untested APIs:
  - Removed `Resource.{get_data_index_within_parent, get_offset_within_root, get_data_unmapped_range, set_data_alignment, fetch, get_related_tags, get_all_attributes, move, get_siblings_as_view, get_siblings}`.
  - Removed `AssemblerServiceInterface.{assemble_many, assemble_file, assemble_files}`.
  - Removed `RawReplaceModifier`, `InjectorModifier`.
  - Removed `ElfProgramHeaderPermission`, replaced usage with `MemoryPermissions` (from `ofrak-type`).
  - Remove unused `Elf,{get_sections_after_index, get_sections_before_index, get_section_header_by_name, get_string_section_header`.
  - Removed `get_parent`/`get_elf` from Elf resource views, `UnanalyzedElfSegment`, `ElfSegmentStructureIndexAnalyzer`, `ElfSectionStructureIndexAnalyzer`, `ElfSymbolStructureIndexAnalyzer`, `ElfModifierUtils`.

### Fixed
- `Resource.create_child` takes either `data` or `data_range` arguments, but not both.
- Remove duplicated work from in resource service serialization, making it faster.
- Miscellaneous bugs in documentation.
- Added `beartype` as requirement for `ofrak`.
- Bump to `fun-coverage==0.2.0` for more accurate test coverage reporting.

### Security
- Bump `lief` dependency to 0.12.2 to avoid [vulnerability](lief-project/LIEF#763) in lower versions.
## 1.0.0 - 2022-09-02
### Added
Initial release. Hello world!
