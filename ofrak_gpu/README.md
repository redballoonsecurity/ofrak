This package contains the GPU-bound implementations of expensive computations performed by OFRAK.

## Futhark Compilation
The [Futhark language](https://futhark-lang.org/) is not required to install and run this module, nor will the Futhark compiler be installed into your Docker container. Instead, `entropy.py`, the compiled pyopencl output of `entropy.fut`, has been provided. If you would like to make any changes to `entropy.fut`, you will have to re-compile `entropy.py` with `futhark pyopencl --library entropy.fut -o entropy.py` - see the `make futhark` target. The `--library` flag must be used.
## Dependencies
This package requires numpy, pyopencl, and an OpenCL platform to run. If you don't have an OpenCL platform and want to test your code, consider [oclgrind, pocl, or another pip-installable CPU runtime for OpenCL](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/misc.html#enabling-access-to-cpus-and-gpus-via-py-opencl). oclgrind is installed by default by requirements-test to run tests. The Futhark compiler is not required, see "Futhark Compilation."

## Testing
This package maintains 100% test coverage of functions. See `ofrak_gpu_test`.
