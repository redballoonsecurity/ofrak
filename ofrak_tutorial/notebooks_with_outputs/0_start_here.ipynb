    "The goal of this tutorial is to help you understand how OFRAK works and how to use it, while interactively showcasing some of its main features.\n",
    "\n",
    "No prior knowledge of OFRAK is required. Basic Python and reverse-engineering knowledge will help.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is organized in a number of lessons. It's recommended to go through them in order, as lessons gradually build on top of each other, from the simplest examples to advanced capabilities of OFRAK.\n",
    "\n",
    "From any lesson, you can navigate to the next one using the \"Next page\" link at the bottom of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to change any code for the examples to work, but you do need to run all Python cells in order to see their outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the objectives for each lesson. The OFRAK-specific vocabulary will be introduced as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Lesson 1: Simple string modification](1_simple_string_modification.ipynb) − manipulate the data of a resource; run a modifier; flush a modified resource to disk\n",
    "- [Lesson 2: A closer look into OFRAK unpacking and the resource tree](2_ofrak_internals.ipynb) − unpack a resource; learn about OFRAK components; learn about auto-analysis, tags, and the resource tree; filter the resource tree\n",
    "- [Lesson 3: Binary format modification](3_binary_format_modification.ipynb) − learn about resource views; find specific children in a resource tree and modify them; manipulate ELF program headers\n",
    "- [Lesson 4: In-place instruction rewriting](4_simple_code_modification.ipynb) − use OFRAK's Ghidra backend; use more filtering capabilities to find specific complex blocks and instructions; assemble an instruction using Keystone; rewrite an instruction in-place\n",
    "- [Lesson 5: Filesystem modification](5_filesystem_modification.ipynb) − learn about OFRAK's filesystem unpacking and modification capabilities; modify a binary from within a filesystem and the filesystem itself\n",
    "- [Lesson 6: Code extension by adding a new segment in the ELF](6_code_insertion_with_extension.ipynb) − add a new segment in an ELF; use the OFRAK PatchMaker to convert a C patch into a binary patch, including a linking step"
