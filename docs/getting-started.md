# Getting Started
## Tutorial
The best way to get started with OFRAK is to go through the interactive tutorial.

Run it with the following commands:
```shell
make tutorial-image  # create the Docker image for the tutorial
make tutorial-run
```

It takes a minute for the notebook to start up. The jupyter notebook URL and token will finally print on the terminal.
Once running, you can access the tutorial from [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) with your web browser. Have fun!

## GUI
OFRAK comes with a web-based GUI frontend for visualizing and manipulating binary targets. To activate the GUI from the
OFRAK tutorial container, run:

```
docker exec -it ofrak-tutorial \
  bash -c "nginx; python /ofrak_server.py 0.0.0.0 8877"
```

Once running, access [localhost:80](http://localhost:80) and start by dropping anything you'd like into it!

Note that for now, the frontend only supports the `ofrak_ghidra` and `ofrak_binary_ninja` analyzer backends.

## Docs
The official documentation for the most up-to-date OFRAK lives at <https://ofrak.com/docs/>.

If you would like to generate the docs yourself for offline viewing, you can serve them from the OFRAK container:
```
docker exec -it ofrak-tutorial \
  mkdocs serve --dev-addr 0.0.0.0:8000
```

The offline docs can then be referenced via web browser at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Guides and examples
Once you've completed the tutorial, you'll be interested in the following resources (which you can see on the left of
this page):

- **More details** about how OFRAK works and how to use it: `User Guide` and `Contributor Guide`;
- **References**: `Examples`, covering common tasks you might want to perform with OFRAK, and the `Code Reference`.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

_Why do my CodeRegions not have any code?_

- You probably forgot to discover the analysis/disassembler backend you intended to use.
- When **not** using the Ghidra analysis backend you will also need to discover the capstone components.
- Check out the [Ghidra Backend User Guide](./user-guide/ghidra.md) and [Binary Ninja Backend User Guides](./user-guide/binary_ninja.md).

_I ran a modifier and flushed the resource. The bytes did change, but my view is reporting the same values. Why?_

- The bytes may have changed, but the analysis that depends on those bytes may not have been forced to re-run. You can force this analysis to update by re-running `await resource.view_as` if you want to get an updated view after modifying data the view depends on.
